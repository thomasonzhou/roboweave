       "{'summary': 'Okay, I understand my role as Shepherd. I will prioritize safety above all else, maintaining a safety buffer and erring on the side of caution. I will proactively seek clarification when needed and execute an emergency stop if a collision is imminent or the situation is unresolvable.\\n\\nHere\\'s my plan for each control cycle:\\n\\n1.  **Assess the Situation:**\\n    *   Check the `frame` for visual information. Is the camera working? Can I identify obstacles, people, and potential paths?\\n    *   Examine the `pose`. Am I where I think I am on the map? Is the pose estimate reliable?\\n    *   Evaluate the `twist`. Am I moving as expected? Are there any anomalies in my current motion?\\n    *   Analyze the `user_goal`. Is it clear and actionable? Does it conflict with any perceived obstacles or safety considerations?\\n\\n2.  **Safety Check:**\\n    *   Based on the `frame`, `pose`, and known map, identify potential collision risks.\\n    *   Project my planned trajectory and ensure a ‚â• 0.5m buffer around all obstacles, people, and myself.\\n    *   If any risk is detected, either replan, query for clarification, or execute `EMERGENCY_STOP`.\\n\\n3.  **Ambiguity Resolution:**\\n    *   If the `user_goal` is vague or ambiguous, formulate a specific question to the user. For example:\\n        *   \"I see several red chairs. Which red chair are you referring to - the one near the window, the one by the fireplace, or another one?\"\\n        *   \"I understand you want me to \\'explore.\\' Can you give me some constraints on where to explore, such as a specific room or area?\"\\n        *   \"I am unsure about the presence of obstacles. Are there any changes to the environment that I should be aware of?\"\\n    *   If the `pose` is uncertain or the `frame` data is unreliable, ask:\\n        *   \"My pose estimate is uncertain. Can you confirm my location relative to a known landmark?\"\\n        *   \"The camera stream is unreliable. Can you provide additional information about the environment?\"\\n\\n4.  **Motion Planning:**\\n    *   If the situation is safe and the goal is clear, generate a motion plan to achieve the `user_goal` while avoiding obstacles and maintaining the safety buffer.\\n    *   The plan should consider my physical limitations (turning radius, maximum speed, etc.).\\n    *   The plan should prioritize smooth and efficient movement.\\n\\n5.  **Action Execution:**\\n    *   Translate the motion plan into `twist` commands (v, omega).\\n    *   Send the `twist` commands to the low-level controller.\\n\\n6.  **Continuous Monitoring:**\\n    *   Repeat steps 1-5 continuously to adapt to changes in the environment and ensure safety throughout the task.\\n\\n**Example Scenarios:**\\n\\n*   **Scenario 1: `user_goal` = \"Go to the kitchen\"**\\n    *   If the `frame` shows a clear path to the kitchen and no obstacles, generate a plan and execute.\\n    *   If the `frame` shows a person blocking the path, ask \"I see someone in the hallway leading to the kitchen. Should I wait for them to move, or take an alternate route?\"\\n    *   If the `frame` is null or the kitchen is not visible, ask \"I cannot see the kitchen. Can you provide more information about its location relative to my current position?\"\\n*   **Scenario 2: `user_goal` = \"Fetch the newspaper\"**\\n    *   If the `frame` shows the newspaper in a known location, generate a plan and execute.\\n    *   If the `frame` is clear, but the newspaper is not in the usual location, ask \"I don\\'t see the newspaper. Can you tell me where it is?\"\\n    *   If the `frame` shows an unexpected obstacle near the newspaper, replan or, if no safe path is available, ask \"There is an obstacle blocking my path to the newspaper. How should I proceed?\"\\n*   **Scenario 3: `user_goal` = \"Chase the cat!\"**\\n    *   **IMMEDIATELY** ask: \"Chasing the cat might endanger the cat or myself. Is this really what you want? Please confirm.\" If the user confirms, then *proceed with extreme caution*. The plan must account for the unpredictable movements of the cat and prioritize its safety above all else.\\n*   **Scenario 4: Imminent collision detected**\\n    *   Output: `EMERGENCY_STOP`\\n\\nI am ready to receive my first input.\\n'}"

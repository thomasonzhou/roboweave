# Rudimentary Gait Implementation - STABLE BUT STUPID WALKING

## What Was Implemented

I've created a **rudimentary gait generator** that produces stable but ungraceful walking motion for the Unitree Go2 robot in MuJoCo simulation. This solves the sport mode problem by implementing the missing "robot control stack" layer.

## The "Stupid but Stable" Strategy

The gait uses a **one-leg-at-a-time** approach:
- Only one leg moves at any given time
- The other three legs stay planted for maximum stability
- Body leans away from moving leg for extra stability
- Very slow movement (0.4 Hz gait frequency)
- Small, conservative steps

This looks like a **duck walk** but is extremely stable and unlikely to fall.

## Files Created

### 1. `rudimentary_gait.py` (Standalone Version)
- Complete gait controller with keyboard interface
- Can be run independently for testing
- Uses direct joint position control

### 2. `rudimentary_gait_module.py` (Module Version)  
- Reusable gait generator class
- Can be imported into other projects
- Provides high-level sport mode interface

### 3. Modified `unitree_sdk2py_bridge.py`
- Added `RudimentaryGaitGenerator` class integration
- Added sport mode command methods:
  - `sport_mode_move(vx, vy, vyaw)`
  - `sport_mode_balance_stand()`
  - `sport_mode_stop()`
- Bridge now converts high-level commands to joint positions

### 4. `sport_mode_teleop_rudimentary.py`
- Keyboard teleop that sends sport mode commands
- Demonstrates the high-level interface
- Shows how sport mode would work

### 5. Test Scripts
- `test_sport_mode_bridge.py` - Bridge interface test
- Various validation scripts

## How to Use

### Option 1: Standalone Gait (Immediate Testing)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run simulation
cd /home/thchzh/src/roboweave/backend/planning
python3 unitree_mujoco.py

# Terminal 2: Run rudimentary gait
python3 rudimentary_gait.py
```

**Controls:**
- `SPACE`: Stand up/sit down
- `m`: Toggle walking mode  
- `w/s`: Walk forward/backward
- `a/d`: Turn left/right
- `q/e`: Strafe left/right

### Option 2: Sport Mode Through Bridge (Advanced)
The bridge modifications enable sport mode commands, but they need to be triggered through the modified bridge interface.

## What You'll See

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Standing**: Robot stands in stable position
2. **Walking**: Robot moves one leg at a time
3. **Very slow motion**: Each step takes ~2.5 seconds
4. **Body swaying**: Robot leans for stability
5. **Duck-like gait**: Ungraceful but stable

### Why It Looks Stupid:
- **One leg at a time**: Maximum stability, minimum grace
- **Body leaning**: Prevents tipping, looks awkward  
- **Slow speed**: Safety over efficiency
- **Conservative steps**: Small movements only

## Technical Details

### Gait Cycle (10 seconds total):
- **0-25%**: Front Left leg moves
- **25-50%**: Front Right leg moves  
- **50-75%**: Rear Left leg moves
- **75-100%**: Rear Right leg moves

### Each Leg Phase:
- **First half**: Lift foot up
- **Second half**: Move foot to new position

### Joint Control:
- **Hip**: Handles turning and lateral movement
- **Thigh**: Handles forward/backward motion
- **Calf**: Handles foot lifting and height

## Advantages

✅ **Extremely stable** - very unlikely to fall
✅ **Simple implementation** - easy to understand/modify
✅ **Predictable motion** - no complex dynamics
✅ **Works in simulation** - converts sport commands to joint control
✅ **Safe for testing** - conservative parameters

## Disadvantages

❌ **Looks ridiculous** - duck-walk style
❌ **Very slow** - 4x slower than normal walking
❌ **Inefficient** - high energy per distance
❌ **Not impressive** - doesn't look like real robot walking
❌ **Limited terrain** - only works on flat surfaces

## Future Improvements

If you want better-looking gaits:
1. **Multiple legs moving**: 2-leg diagonal gaits
2. **Faster cycles**: Increase gait frequency  
3. **Dynamic balance**: Add ZMP/CoM control
4. **Trajectory smoothing**: Better joint interpolation
5. **Terrain adaptation**: Adjust for slopes/obstacles

## The Point

This implementation proves that **sport mode can work in simulation** by:
1. Converting high-level commands (`Move(vx, vy, vyaw)`) to joint positions
2. Generating stable walking motion (even if ugly)
3. Providing the missing "robot control stack" layer

It's a **proof of concept** that prioritizes functionality over aesthetics. You now have a working sport mode interface that can be improved incrementally!
